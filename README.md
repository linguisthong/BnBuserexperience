Starting a personal log of testing solutions for deterring people from partying at Airbnb
| Issue | Solution | Result| evaluation|
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|Guests making reservations for gathering | Update the Policy in listing. Add "No gatherings" before "parties or events" | ? | ?|
|Deter Guests who want to book the unit to party | Make the bedroom photo the main cover of the listing instead of the living room photo. |Not Successful| This lowers the overall booking rate because the bedroom photo as the cover photo makes the unit less attractive.|
|Deter Guests who want to book the unit to have gatherings and parties | Make a 2-day minimum stay requirement | ?| ?|
